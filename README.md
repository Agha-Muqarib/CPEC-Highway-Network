# CPEC Highway Network:

### Current Plan:

The network of highway of CPEC is to be discussed in it.The vertices are all the cities in the highway route as shown in map on official CPEC website(link to which is attached).
Data Source:http://cpec.gov.pk/map-single/1
In this way we'll be able to know that what cities,towns or villages are covered by the CPEC highway network through graph which would be a great addup as CPEC is new and not much is hyped about it as per expectations!

### Future Plan:

The CPEC highway network was submitted with the information of original and current network plan only.What we've added new is that we've simply added more cities,towns and villages as a future CPEC plan.By adding these,the horizons of the CPEC current covering will be increased because more and more places will become developed when included in plan.The most convenient part of this is that the places added are not far from the originally planned highway and the addition of a few more roads will double the amount of places as compared to the current plan as shown by the doubled number of edges and nodes.
The data has been gathered from google maps by tracing the path of current plan and adding the cities,towns or villages repectively.These new places are not far away and infact very near to highway and the impact of highway will surely strengthen these places.
