# CPEC-Highway-Network
The network of highway of CPEC is to be discussed in it.The vertices are all the cities in the highway route as shown in map on official CPEC website(link to which is attached).
Data Source:http://cpec.gov.pk/map-single/1
In this way we'll be able to know that what cities,towns or villages are covered by the CPEC highway network through graph which would be a great addup as CPEC is new and not much is hyped about it as per expectations!
