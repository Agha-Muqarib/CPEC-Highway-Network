The CPEC highway network was submitted with the information of original and current network plan only.What we've added new is that we've simply added more cities,towns and villages as a future CPEC plan.By adding these,the horizons of the CPEC current covering will be increased because more and more places will become developed when included in plan.The most convenient part of this is that the places added are not far from the originally planned highway and the addition of a few more roads will double the amount of places as compared to the current plan as shown by the doubled number of edges and nodes.
